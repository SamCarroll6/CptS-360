# CptS-360
Systems Programming course at Washington State University

# Lab 1
First project for course. For part 1 it was assigned to print various variables and their addresses including parameter variables from main. Also to print the the stack frame link list, and the stack contents in the frame of main (this was limited to 128 entries). For part 2 it was assigned to write your own printf function called "myprintf" which takes an arbitrary number of parameters and works the same as the C standard function "printf".

# Lab 2
Second project for course. Make a simplified version of the Linux kernel. The files in it are simple nodes and don't do anything, the purpose was to build functional versions of various Linux commands and have them operate on a tree we developed that would replicate the feel of a real linux kernel.
